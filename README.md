# JampackSaved
A saved version of the Jampack matrix package (which is why the projet is called JampackSaved and not Jampack). The Jampack matrix package is a package from the [Mathematical and Computations Sciences Division](https://www.nist.gov/itl/math) from NIST. 

A zip file containing both the source code an the class files is available at [NIST website](https://math.nist.gov/pub/Jampack/Jampack/AboutJampack.html). Note that the zip does not contain any buld system (ant, maven, make, etc...) and no jar files either. It also appear that the code has no licence at all.

# Licence
It appear that the original Jampack code has no licence at all.

# Documentation
The documentation is avilable in the original zip file, and it retained here. Also you can view it online [here](https://math.nist.gov/pub/Jampack/Jampack/Doc/00_Manual.html#mancont).
